      The UI built with React is
      <Text style={{ color: "blue" }}> reactive</Text>. As a developer, you just
      need to write down what you want and React figures out how to do it. When
      data change, your UI changes accordingly. You donâ€™t need to worry about
      updating the DOM, React does it for you automatically. The idea of
      reactive UI greatly simplifies UI development.
